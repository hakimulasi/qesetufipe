"I just sat down at the piano and I started to work on this tune and the lyrics just came right out. I was drunk, that's the truth. I have never written anything sober in my life.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"I thought this is a great concept," he explained. "I am going to write this song about a guy whose girlfriend thinks she's the greatest and dumps him.

He was initially concerned that listeners would think it was about the Crimea River but that “sitting down and playing the melody and coming up with lyrics made it a nonissue”.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Is it just us, or does Michael's version sound like a Bond song?</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=19><h2 class=title>'Everything'</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/l-wJaLftzAM/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Michael Bublé - Everything at Madison Square Garden [Live]</p><p class=paragraph-text>Michael said of this song: "I wrote that song about the great happiness of real love, but at the same time I was making a statement about the world. We're living in really crazy times, and I wanted to say that no matter what's happening, this person in my life is what really makes it worthwhile."</p><p class=paragraph-text>However, after he broke up with the influence for the song, his ex-girlfriend actress Emily Blunt, he admitted he found it hard to sing live: "I'm OK now. But straight after, well, I didn't want to listen to music. Forget about my music. I couldn't do anything. The only good thing I did do was I went and got a therapist.</p><p class=paragraph-text>“I felt bad for everybody involved. It's definitely worse cause it's all done publicly. You go to the grocery store and it's in every magazine. It's the same thing that's happened in my other break-ups. It's always tough. You grow attached to someone and they become your best friend. You lose a friend – that's one of the most difficult parts. I'm a sentimental person."</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=16><h2 class=title>'Haven't Met You Yet'</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/zS-_wGmn8jk/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Haven't Met You Yet</p><p class=paragraph-text>This was arguably the song that transformed Michael into a worldwide superstar. Before this, he was mainly known for cover versions and hadn't had a huge singles hit. But this song reached the UK top 10 and helped his album Crazy Love become a monster success.</p><p class=paragraph-text>He was inspired by his wife, Argentine actress and model Luisana Lopilato for this, who was his fiancée at the time he wrote it.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"I wrote it because I had met this girl and there was nothing solid about anything of it. She didn't speak English. There was every reason to not try to get into this predicament of a relationship, yet I did and it was weird. The song came from that – it was inspired by meeting her.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"You live on your potential as a single person – it keeps you sane. I'm not saying that you can't be alone and be happy but there's this great way to keep your sanity where it's like you know it's going to happen – you just haven't met them yet."</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=4><h2 class=title>'Home'</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/lbSOLBMUvIE/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Michael Bublé - Home [Official Music Video]</p><p class=paragraph-text>This was one of Michael's first hits that was an original song rather than a cover version.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Michael wrote this song for his ex-fiancée, Debbie Timuss, about the pain of being away from her while he traveled the world during their relationship of eight years.</p></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLnOqKuhqpGZtrB6wqikaJmiqba0wNJopKKbmJayrXnBrpmlnV%2BXsrTAjKymp5%2BjYrmqv9NmraKclaTAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paige-turnah-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paige Turnah Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kirk-cameron-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kirk Cameron Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demi-bagby.html>Demi Bagby Biography | Age, Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Boyfriend?|</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-waters-net-worth.html>Derek Waters Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doechii.html>Doechii</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./former-dc-artist-ethan-van-sciver-claims-superman-will-be-made-gay-in-future-comics.html>Former DC Artist Ethan Van Sciver Claims Superman Will Be Made Gay In Future Comics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-refill-pre-inked-stamps-html.html>How do you refill Pre Inked Stamps?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
