Joined by their 13-year-old son, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Maddox</strong></a> — who looked all grown up in a tux just like his dad’s — the longtime loves owned the spotlight.</p><p>Jolie, who was at the event to accept the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, was a knockout in a black Atelier Versace gown with a Swarovski-embellished skirt. Her hair, which appeared lighter than usual, was pulled back into an elegant bun at the nape of her neck, showing off her sparkly Robert Procop <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a>.</p><p>Her fiance Pitt, meanwhile, looked dashing in a black tux and crisp white shirt. His hair — worn long and blonde in recent months — was cut shorter on top and shaved close on the sides of his head.</p><p>Maddox, the oldest of the couple’s six children, also cut a rather dapper figure. Standing tall (past Jolie’s shoulders), the Cambodian-born teen looked all grown up in a tuxedo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-inline.jpg><p>Inside the venue, the trio laughed and chatted with celebs including <strong>Emma Thompson</strong> and <strong>David O. Russell</strong>. Once the ceremony started, Pitt, 49, put an affectionate arm around his fiancee’s shoulder. Later, as the Maleficent star, 38, rose to accept her award, she gave the 12 Years a Slave actor a quick kiss.</p><p>Referring to Pitt as her “love” onstage, the actress thanked him for always being there for her. “Your support and your guidance make everything that I do possible,” she gushed.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She also paid tribute to her eldest son. “Mad, I’m not gonna cry, I promise. I won’t embarrass you,” she said. “You and your brothers and your sisters are my happiness. And there is no greater honor in this world than being your mom.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/d4cac7731a12f9bdd5f979d49eb6d4dab95eae63.jpg><p>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Special Envoy went on to talk about her passion for philanthropy. “I came into this business young and worried about my own experiences, my own pain. And it was only when I began to travel and look at life beyond my home that I understood my responsibility to others,” she explained. “I’ve met survivors of war and famine, rape. I’ve learned what life is like for most people in this world. And how fortunate I was to have food to eat and a roof over my head, a safe place to live and the joy of having my family safe and healthy. And I have realized how sheltered I have been. And I was determined never to be that way again.”</p><p>“I have never understood why some people are lucky enough to be born with the chance that I had, to have this path in life,” she continued. “And why across the world, there’s a woman just like me, with the same abilities and the same desires and the same work ethic and love for her family, who would most likely make better films and better speeches — only she sits in a refugee camp…I don’t know why this is my life and that’s hers. I don’t understand that but I will do as my mother asked, and I will do the best I can with this life, to be of use.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5e%2ForCMqaCtrF2otbDD0mamn55do7K4eceaoKurpK65pnnWoquhZZGjtKa4yKeYZqKfobamecarprCmXaq9brjOqKKippdiuqKww6ivZpmkYrSwwsSrpaiqk6rBtHnAsJirnKNivaqv066pnqtdZ31yf5BxaGpn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./creadel-red-jones-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Creadel &amp;quot;Red&amp;quot; Jones Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./baby-putie-baju-pink.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Baby Putie Baju Pink Viral: On Reddit, Tiktok, Instagram, Youtube, Twitter &amp;amp; Telegram</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demi-bagby.html>Demi Bagby Biography | Age, Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Boyfriend?|</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-waters-net-worth.html>Derek Waters Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doechii.html>Doechii</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./former-dc-artist-ethan-van-sciver-claims-superman-will-be-made-gay-in-future-comics.html>Former DC Artist Ethan Van Sciver Claims Superman Will Be Made Gay In Future Comics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-refill-pre-inked-stamps-html.html>How do you refill Pre Inked Stamps?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
