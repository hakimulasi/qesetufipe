She is a model and actress, however, she is perhaps unfortunately best known for her relationship and subsequent divorce proceedings with the former NFL player <a href=#>Deion Sanders</a>, which is a main source of Pilar Sanders’ net worth. She debuted in the entertainment industry as a model in 1990.</p><p>How rich is this model and actress? Estimations by authoritative sources show that Pilar Sanders net worth currently stands at $10 million, however, it looks like Pilar wanted to make quite a fortune and sued her former husband to pay $14,000 per month for child support and mortgage. She even managed to present a $24,000 bill in which such items as $2,000 for children’s lessons, $2,000 for food and restaurants, $1,000 for entertainment, $900 clothing, $750 child care, $500 school lunches, $500 cell phones and $450 personal care and haircuts were included, quite an extensive list of expenditures. As the custody of the children is divided between the parents, the requested amounts were not awarded. More, the court ordered her to pay $275,000 to Pilar’s attorneys in legal fees.</p><h3>Pilar Sanders Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>To begin with, Pilar grew up in New York. While still being a student at high school she pursued a career in modelling, securing contracts with two prestigious modelling companies, Irene Marie and Ford Models. At that time modelling was not only a very important part of her life, it was also a very significant source of Pilar Sanders’ net worth.</p><p>In addition to being a model, Pilar became involved in acting. She created roles in episodes of several series including the sitcom “The <a href=#>Jamie Foxx</a> Show” (1996) created by Bentley Kyle Evans and <a href=#>Jamie Foxx</a>, the police procedural series “Walker, Texas Ranger” (1997) created by Albert S. Ruddy, Leslie Greif, <a href=#>Paul Haggis</a> and Christopher Canaan, the sitcoms “In Da House” (1998) created by Winifred Hervey and “Veronica’s Closet” (1999) created by <a href=#>David Crane</a> and Martha Kauffman. Those roles also increased the net worth of Pilar.</p><p>More, the reality television series which focused on the home life of Pilar and her husband entitled “<a href=#>Deion</a> and Pilar: Prime Time Love” (2008) was on Oxygen television channel for one season. The series was co-produced by her husband <a href=#>Deion Sanders</a>, though due to low ratings it was closed. More, Pilar has launched the children summer camp Prime Time Achievers which has also added sums to the overall size of her net worth. Additionally, it should be mentioned that she founded Essence of Beshalom, a foundation to support girls, to be precise to make them feel more confident.</p><p>Some facts about the private life of Pilar Sanders: she married the professional football player <a href=#>Deion Sanders</a> in 1999, and they have three children. Because of the constant abuse in the family Pilar Sanders filed for divorce. The two separated in 2012, and the divorce settlement was ended in 2013. However, Pilar was jailed for seven days in 2014 for failing to return the children to <a href=#>Deion</a>, and he has sued her for defamation over her allegation of child abuse.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=17.097944377267><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 10, 1974</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Elmira, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 8 in (1.75 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress, Producer, Model</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Deion Sanders (m. 1999–2013)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Shelomi Sanders, Shedeur Sanders, Shilo Sanders</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Dan Biggers, Jeanette Biggers</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Scottie Biggers, Kandie Biggers</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nicknames</td><td>Pilar Biggers , Pilar Biggers-Sanders , Miss P , P-Love , Pilar Biggers Sanders Love El-Dey</td></tr><tr readability=0.3265306122449><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/LovePilarSanders</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/pilarsanders/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0081790</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Movies</td><td>"Percentage" (2014), "Streets of Blood" (2009), "The Mod Squad" (1999)</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>TV Shows</td><td>"Football Wives" (2010), “Deion and Pilar: Prime Time Love” (2008), “In Da House” (1998), “Veronica’s Closet” (1999), “Walker, Texas Ranger” (1997)</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=1.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>People are going to call you many things, but it is what you answer to that counts.</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=2.3006134969325><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=4.5886075949367><td>1</td><td>Has 3 children with her now ex-husband <a href=#>Deion Sanders</a>: 2 sons, Shilo Sanders (b.2001) and Shedeur Sanders (b.2003), and one daughter Shelomi Sanders (b.2004).</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><h3 class=toggle-head>Actress <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actress readability=3><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>A Heart That Forgives</td><td>2016</td><td></td><td>Shelia</td></tr><tr><td>Percentage</td><td>2014</td><td></td><td>Store Owner</td></tr><tr><td>Single Ladies</td><td>2011-2012</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Jennifer</td></tr><tr><td>Cowboy and Lucky</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Echo</td></tr><tr><td>Cowboy and Lucky</td><td>2009</td><td></td><td>Nanny</td></tr><tr><td>Streets of Blood</td><td>2009</td><td>Video</td><td>Yolanda</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Series</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Today</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Series</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Inspector Mom: Kidnapped in Ten Easy Steps</td><td>2007</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Sapphire</td></tr><tr><td>Walker, Texas Ranger</td><td>1999</td><td>TV Series</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Mod Squad</td><td>1999</td><td></td><td>Pickup Girl (as Pilar Biggers)</td></tr><tr><td>Veronica's Closet</td><td>1998</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Laurel</td></tr><tr><td>Built to Last</td><td>1997</td><td>TV Series</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Jamie Foxx Show</td><td>1997</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Daphne</td></tr><tr><td>Claude's Crib</td><td>1997</td><td>TV Series</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Producer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=producer readability=2><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>Deion and Pilar Sanders: Prime Time Love</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Series producer -
