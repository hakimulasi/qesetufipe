Their latest single, ‘When The Song Is Over,’ delves into themes of self-love and personal growth, offering a message of empowerment. In this exclusive interview, the dynamic duo shares insights into their creative process, their evolving sound, and the impact of recognition on their artistic journey. As they take the plunge into the vibrant music scene of Los Angeles, Dawn & Prax promise exciting collaborations and a continued commitment to creating music with depth and meaning. Join us on a journey through their artistic evolution and the future of pop music.</p><p><strong>Welcome to CelebMix, Dawn and Prax! Can you tell a little bit about yourself to our readers?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We’re both Moroccan-born and bred, and we share a real love for music. We’re artists, music producers, and songwriters, and when we came together as Dawn & Prax, we had a common goal in mind. We wanted to create dance-pop music that isn’t just catchy, but also has a message that resonates with people in our own special way. It’s all about infusing the fun of pop with a deeper, more personal touch. We believe that music can be a powerful force for connection and expression. Our music reflects our identity and our story, and we hope it resonates with others just as much as it does with us.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>Congratulations on your latest single, ‘When The Song Is Over.’ Can you tell us about the inspiration behind this emotionally charged track?</strong></p><p>In our very first chat with Connor, we ended up talking for hours, and the topic of our relationship statuses came up. Connor opened up about how he used to jump from one relationship to another but was now taking the time to heal and grow personally. Right then, Karim and I knew, ‘This is the song!</p><p><strong>As artists, you’ve previously explored electronic music. How has your creative process evolved with ‘When The Song Is Over,’ incorporating more elements of pop?</strong></p><p>What made this song truly unique was the fact that we produced it simultaneously as we wrote it. We took great care to ensure that every element in the music not only followed the vocals but also amplified the core message of the song. It is especially evident in the pre-chorus, where you can hear those unison hits perfectly aligning with the vocals. It’s also showcased in all the “ear candies” sprinkled throughout the track, mirroring the imagery we’ve painted in the lyrics</p><p><strong>Your music is known for transcending genre boundaries. What draws you to this experimental approach, and how do you maintain a cohesive sound while doing so?</strong></p><p>It’s undoubtedly challenging, yet it also flows quite naturally. We firmly believe that your artistic identity should be an organic reflection of yourself; it shouldn’t be something you impose. What we’re trying to convey is that we all possess unique tastes, and the key is to trust those instincts. As producers and songwriters, it’s about utilizing the tools at your disposal to create the sound that truly resonates with you.</p><p><strong>The single’s themes revolve around self-love and personal growth. Could you share more about the message you’re conveying through this track?</strong></p><p>When we sit down to write a song, it often comes from the challenges or issues we’re personally facing. But rather than venting or complaining in our music, we choose to take a different approach. We see our songs as pep talks to ourselves, if that makes sense. For instance, in this particular song, we explore all the bad habits we’ve developed to shield ourselves from our problems and insecurities. Through our music, we try to encourage not just ourselves but also our listeners to confront these issues head-on. The message we want to convey is that you don’t need those habits to be happy; it’s all about realizing that ‘You are enough!’</p><p><strong>You’ve achieved significant recognition with previous releases. How has this recognition impacted your creative journey and the expectations you set for yourselves?</strong></p><p>We’re genuinely appreciative of the love and support we’ve received from the industry. It has not only been crucial in advancing our careers and earning us credibility in the eyes of industry peers, but it has also resonated with our family and friends. However, the most profound form of recognition comes from our fans. There’s nothing quite like receiving a message from a fan, expressing how our music helped them navigate a tough period in their life. This, fundamentally, is why we create music—to connect with people. The ability to touch the lives of more and more individuals is an incredible gift, and we’re incredibly grateful for it.</p><p><strong>You’ve recently relocated to Los Angeles. How has this change of environment influenced your music and your creative process?</strong></p><p>Los Angeles is the best place to be as a creative. Our time here has enabled us to connect with like-minded people who have not only become our regular collaborators but also our dearest friends. It’s also a city where artists, producers, and songwriters can truly cultivate their careers. We’ve been fortunate to seize opportunities to work with industry legends, and we’re eagerly looking forward to sharing the results of these collaborations.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>In your own words, how has ‘When The Song Is Over’ marked an evolution in your artistic journey? What are the new dimensions of pop music you’re embracing?</strong></p><p>This is undeniably a pivotal moment for us. With this song, we’ve gone beyond the typical dance floor, feel-good vibe. We delved deep to convey a message that holds immense significance for us, both vocally and sonically. Our goal is to continue creating music with depth and meaning, just like this one, without missing out the chance to produce a club banger when the inspiration strikes.</p><p><strong>The music industry can be challenging. What motivates you to continue creating meaningful music that resonates deeply with your listeners?</strong></p><p>The music industry can be tough. Getting your music heard is a challenge, and turning music into a full-time profession is even harder. Yet, you have to hold onto the belief that this is your true calling, that your voice matters. In these hard times, your inner circle of family, friends, and collaborators becomes invaluable. They’re the ones who consistently remind you of who you are when things don’t go as planned.</p><p><strong>As a duo, how do you complement each other’s strengths and creative visions in the music-making process?</strong></p><p>Honestly, each one of us carries an equal load; we’re both well-rounded musicians and contribute whenever we have something to add to the song we’re working on.-</p><p><strong>What can we expect in terms of future plans for Dawn & Prax? Are there any upcoming projects or collaborations you’d like to share with your fans?</strong></p><p>Expect more songs, more exciting collaborations with Connor MacKay, DeadRose and others. We’re bringing you music that’ll get you on the dance floor and make you shed a tear or two.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ktq%2FAxKutop2nYsSqwMdmm5qvnmK9s63XZpqrmZaptq%2BzjJ2Yp5uVYr2wvIywoK2gXZZ6pbHEqZyrZaCqv7G70p5m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jamie-jools-oliver-sell-london-home-six-million-profit.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jamie Oliver and wife Jools' major home change after renewing their vows</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./happy-days-star-erin-moran-cause-of-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Happy Days star Erin Moran's cause of death revealed</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demi-bagby.html>Demi Bagby Biography | Age, Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Boyfriend?|</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-waters-net-worth.html>Derek Waters Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doechii.html>Doechii</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./former-dc-artist-ethan-van-sciver-claims-superman-will-be-made-gay-in-future-comics.html>Former DC Artist Ethan Van Sciver Claims Superman Will Be Made Gay In Future Comics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-refill-pre-inked-stamps-html.html>How do you refill Pre Inked Stamps?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
