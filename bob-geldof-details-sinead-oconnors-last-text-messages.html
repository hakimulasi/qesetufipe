Her family confirmed the news on Wednesday, July 26. “It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Sinéad,” they said in a statement to RTE. “Her family and friends are devastated and have requested privacy at this very difficult time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bob-Geldof-Says-Friend-Sinead-OConnors-Final-Text-Messages-Were-Laden-With-Desperation3.jpg><p>A cause of death was not immediately confirmed, but British authorities said that <a href=#>they do not suspect foul play</a>. London’s Metropolitan Police said officers responded to “reports of an unresponsive woman at a residential address” in the city, adding that O’Connor was “pronounced dead at the scene.”</p><p>The police <a href=#>notified O’Connor’s family</a> after she was found. “The death is not being treated as suspicious,” the statement continued. An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of O’Connor’s death.</p><p>Before his public tribute to O’Connor, Geldof said that he’d known her since she was very young. According to Geldof, O’Connor was a big fan of his band, the Boomtown Rats.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bob-Geldof-Says-Friend-Sinead-OConnors-Final-Text-Messages-Were-Laden-With-Desperation2.jpg><p>“Sinéad lived down the road from me and Garry [Roberts], the guitar player in the band who died about six or seven months ago. We are quite literally down the road,” Geldof told Irish Web TV. “So, we’ve known that girl most of her life, really. She was a big Rats fan.”</p><p>Geldof explained that the band wanted to <a href=#>dedicate their Cavan Calling performance</a> to O’Connor because it felt like “the only thing” they could do to <a href=#>honor her memory</a>. “We were friends all the way through,” he continued. “She was signed to the same little record label we were signed to, by the same guy, had the same manager and stuff like that, so there’s a big connection there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabp5JitKa4w6idZpyVqa6quNJmqqKmlZaxbrvCqKWnp6Koeq2t0q1krZ2oqXqusdKsmKCdo2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./camila-cabello-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Camila Cabello Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./billy-hufsey-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Billy Hufsey Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demi-bagby.html>Demi Bagby Biography | Age, Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Boyfriend?|</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-waters-net-worth.html>Derek Waters Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doechii.html>Doechii</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./former-dc-artist-ethan-van-sciver-claims-superman-will-be-made-gay-in-future-comics.html>Former DC Artist Ethan Van Sciver Claims Superman Will Be Made Gay In Future Comics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-refill-pre-inked-stamps-html.html>How do you refill Pre Inked Stamps?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
