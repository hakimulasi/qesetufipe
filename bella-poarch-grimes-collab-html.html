But now, she is pursuing the art professionally.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>One of her first big steps into the music industry just so happened to be with one of her closest friends, well-established musician <a href=# rel=follow>Grimes</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>How Bella Poarch and Grimes Collaborated</h2><p>Poarch first met Grimes through Benny Blanco. Blanco already knew Grimes at that time.</p><p>One day, the two were in his studio. Poarch just decided to pay him a visit there, and that's when their friendship started.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>During her interview with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Cosmopolitan</a> in March 2022, she also hinted that they might have struck more than just a friendship during their meeting. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"We might have a song together," said the TikTok star, casually dropping news about a new song for their fans. She then swiftly moved on to talk about other things about their friendship, maybe not realizing that she might have sent the internet on a frenzy.</p><p>Grimes also gave her book recommendations. One of her first recommendations to her was Life 3.0: being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence.</p><p>"I would've never thought I would read about AI, but I did," Poarch gushed about the suggestion. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They also did other activities — activities that would normally not be associated with being casual, like jousting or falconry.</p><p><img alt="Bella Poarch hinted at a new song collab she did with Grimes after meeting due to Benny Blanco." height=750 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/Bella-Poarch-Grimes-new-song.jpg width=750 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Bella Poarch hinted at a new song collab she did with Grimes after meeting due to Benny Blanco.</strong> (Photo: Bella Poarch/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Music isn't the only thing they collaborated on. Huge stars on TikTok, the company once proposed a "first drop" NFT project to them. The company's plan was to release exclusive NFTs with a few artists, Poarch and Grimes being two of them.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They collaborated on the project. But unfortunately for everyone involved, the project never gained much traction, was badly handled, and the releases never happened.</p><h2>Bella Poarch's Connection with Big Artists</h2><p>Other than Grimes, Poarch has collaborated with many other mainstream music artists as of late.</p><p>One of her biggest collaborations was her TikTok collab with Blanco and Justin Bieber for Blanco's song 'Lonely.' But, as much as it was appreciated by many as a big step in her career,&nbsp;many were also critical of the collab.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>When the video was released, people were saying she was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">not famous enough</a> to be collaborating with the likes of Blanco and Bieber.</p><p>Poarch also&nbsp;collaborated with&nbsp;Sub Urban for 'INFERNO' and <a href=# rel=follow>has a single out</a> until now. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As for her collaboration with Grimes, there's no information regarding the date and other specifics, but if one was to speculate, the song could be a part of Grimes's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">upcoming album</a>, Book 1. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Or it could be a part of her EP Fairies Cum First, "a prelude" to Book 1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqVobmiec%2BomKubmGK0s7XMnqpmm5%2BhuaKujaGrpqQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-open-elevator-door.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to open elevator door</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anthony-benedetti-clem-doore-gert-b-frobe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fan Casting Christopher Walken as Anthony Benedetti/Clem Doore/Gert B.
