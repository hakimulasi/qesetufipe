His ability to get under his opponent's skin and his abrasive playing style earned him the nickname "the Worm." He was at times one of the highest-paid players in the NHL thanks largely to an 8-year $69 million deal signed with Anaheim in 2013. During his career in total, Corey Perry earned right around $80 million in salary.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Perry was born on May 16, 1985 in New Liskeard, Ontario, Canada. He was the first of two sons born to parents Geoff and Nancy Parry. His father worked in law enforcement. When Perry was ten, his family moved from Haileybury, Ontario to Peterborough, Ontario</p><p>Along with this younger brother Adam, Perry learned to skate at the age of two. He began playing hockey with the Peterborough Minor Petes AAA organization of the OMHA's Eastern AAA league. In 2001, he helped lead the team to victory in the inaugural OHL Cup Bantam AAA Championship in Peterborough.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Because of his successful minor league career, Perry was drafted fifth overall into the Ontario Hockey League by the London Knights in the 2001 Priority Draft. During his rookie season, he recorded 59 points in 60 games, setting himself up well for his second season, his NHL draft year. He improved his record to 78 points and was selected 28th overall in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, though he continued playing for the Knights. During the 2003-04 season, he became the first Knight to reach 100 points in a season since player Jason Allison did in 1994.</p><p>In his fourth year with the Knights, he scored a junior career-high of 130 points in 60 games. The following season, he made his professional debut with the Ducks in 2005. He scored his first career goal against the Edmonton Oilers on October 10th and then went on to score a point in each of his first four career games. During the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs, Perry did not score a goal but did manage three assists before the Ducks were eliminated in the Western Conference Final to Edmonton.</p><p>The following season, Perry improved his scoring records and helped the Ducks reach the 2007 Stanley Cup playoffs, scoring 15 points in 21 games. In a dramatic run-up to the final, Perry was instrumental in several critical games and helped the Ducks secure its first-ever Stanley Cup. During the 2007-08 season, he again increased his scoring total and was named to his first NHL All-Star Game as an injury replacement. He also made Ducks history in January when he scored a goal in just 16 seconds into the game, the second fastest goal ever scored by a Duck. However, the Ducks did not replicate their previous year success, losing to the Dallas Stars in the 2008 Conference Quarterfinals. During the off-season, Perry signed a five-year contract extension with the Ducks.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-165631 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Corey-Perry.jpg alt="Corey Perry" width=594 height=392 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-165631 class=wp-caption-text>Jeff Gross/Getty Images</p><p>The next season, 2008, was Perry's break-out year. He led the Ducks with 32 goals and finished second on the team with 72 points. However, he was suspended for four games by the NHL when he elbowed another player during gameplay. The Ducks ultimately finished their season during the Western Conference Semifinals against the Detroit Red Wings. Perry performed even better the following season, in 2009, and then in the 2010-11 season, he led the NHL with 50 goals, earning the Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy as result. He was also chosen to play in the 2011 NHL All-Star Game. The Ducks ultimately were eliminated from the 2011 playoffs, though Perry performed well. He won the Hart Memorial Trophy and was named the NHL's regular season MVP in 2011.</p><p>Perry continued playing well during the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons, though both years were disappointing for the Ducks during the playoffs. Nonetheless, Perry signed an eight-year contract extension with the team in March of 2013. The following season, 2013-14, proved to be one of Perry's best seasons and he was selected to the First All-Star team for the second time in his career. However, his scoring and goal production began declining slowly over the subsequent seasons and then he suffered an injury requiring surgery in 2018. In June of 2019, his 14-year career with the Ducks ended after he was bought out of the remaining two years of his contract, making him a free agent.</p><p>In July of 2019, Perry signed a one-year contract with the Dallas Stars. On November 13, 2019, he played his 1,000 career regular season NHL game, becoming the 340th player in NHL history to hit that milestone. After a season with the stars, he signed as a free agent a one-year contract with the Montreal Canadians. Following that season, he left the Canadians to join the Tampa Bay Lightning, signing a two-year contract with the team in July of 2021.</p><p>Outside of regular NHL play, Perry has also played on the Canadian national team in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, helping them win the gold medal against the United States. He also joined the team again at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, where they again won gold.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Perry's younger brother Adam also plays hockey and the two played together on the London Knights' 2005 Memorial Cup-winning team, though he eventually decided to pursue law enforcement and became a police officer.</p><p>Perry lives in London, Ontario during the hockey off-season. He began dating girlfriend Blakeny Robertson early in life and the two married on July 18, 2015. The couple had their first son, Griffin, in August of 2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNktbCvyp6waJufp7K6ec%2BeqauxXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fabiana-udenio.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fabiana Udenio Fan Casting</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cody-harris-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Cody Harris Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demi-bagby.html>Demi Bagby Biography | Age, Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Boyfriend?|</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-waters-net-worth.html>Derek Waters Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doechii.html>Doechii</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./former-dc-artist-ethan-van-sciver-claims-superman-will-be-made-gay-in-future-comics.html>Former DC Artist Ethan Van Sciver Claims Superman Will Be Made Gay In Future Comics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-refill-pre-inked-stamps-html.html>How do you refill Pre Inked Stamps?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
