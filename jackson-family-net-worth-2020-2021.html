The group consisted of six children whose parents are Joseph Walter and Katherine Esther Jackson, and they initially formed the band called “The Jackson 5,” which was later changed to the “Jackson Family.” The music group was managed by their father Joe Walter, and since the late 1960s, they have achieved a lot of success. They have been referred to as the “Royal Family of Pop” or “The First Family of Soul over the years.</p><p>The group originally consisted of the late Michael Jackson, Jackie, Janet, Marlon, Tito, and Jermaine. Janet and Michael are regarded as the most popular members of the group, and this is mainly because they were able to achieve a lot of success in their solo careers. They are among the most influential pop and R&B artists in the history of music. Janet was the first black woman to win the Billboard Icon Award, while his brother Michael is frequently referred to as “The King of Pop.”</p><h2>Inception</h2><p>The father of the Jacksons is Joseph Walter Jackson, born in Arkansas, on 26 July 1928. He is the son of Samuel Jackson and Crystal Lee King, and he grew up in Oakland, California. At the age of 21, he got married to Katherine Scruse, who was 19 at the time, and they immediately started a family. The family grew steadily, and within no time, the couple had nine children.</p><p>Joe saw the talent in his children, especially Tito, who began playing the guitar at a very early age. He then formed a band for his sons Tito, Jackie, and Jermaine in 1964, and he called it “The Jackson Brothers.” The group did several local shows, and later, Joe included his younger sons Michael and Marlon in the band. He was the group’s manager, and he changed the name of the group to “The Jackson Five.”</p><h2>Evolution</h2><p>The group signed its first contract in 1967 with Steeltown Records. They recorded several hit songs with Michael being the lead singer, and they became very famous under the management of their father, Joe. After great success, he moved his family to a mansion in Encino, California. There developed tension between Michael and his father, and this made him leave the group to pursue a solo career in 1979. In 1983 Joe was fired as the group’s manager, and he was accused of both mental and physical abuse.</p><p>Janet Jackson also went on a solo career, and she, just like her brother Michael, has been able to achieve a lot of success. They were both awarded stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1980, 1984, and 1990. As a solo artist, Michael was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Janet was also inducted in 2019.</p><p>The third generation of the family is made up of 26 children, some of whom have followed in the footsteps of their parents. The most known of these children are Michael’s children, Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson, and Prince Michael Jackson. These kids became more famous after the death of their father, Michael Jackson, in 2009.</p><p>The three sons of Tito are the members of the R&B/Pop music group by the name of 3T. Rebbie Jacksons’ son Austin Brown is a singer and a songwriter. The son of Jackie Jackson is a hip hop artist who goes by the name of Dealz. The newest member of the family is the daughter of Janet Jackson Eissa Al Mana, who was born on 3 January 2017 when Janet was 50 years old.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>The Jackson Family is one of the most influential families in the music industry, and it has won several accolades over the years. The Jackson 5 was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. As solo artists, Michael and Janet have been inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame three times.
