Jean shared how early in life she fell in love with music. She said:</p><p>“When I was five or six I would write poems. I would hide in my closet at night and write my emotions and cry and be romantic and then my poems became songs. When I was 13 I started writing actual songs and that turned into me wanting to sing and then I started taking voice lessons. I did piano lessons too when I was very young.”</p><p>Jean is not just a gifted guitarist but also a remarkable lyricist; she wrote “If I Were A Boy” specifically for Beyoncé.
