The numbers of people reporting they received this scam call are surpassing anything I previously heard about in the fraud world. And the pace only seems to be increasing with the passage of time.</p><p><strong>Facebook prize winners keep winning</strong><br>clintonherald.com — I’m hearing on a weekly basis from people receiving messages through Facebook from “friends” who try to convince the receiving party they are eligible for a big grant or prize. To receive said prize or grant, the receiver of the message must get in touch, through text messaging or email, with a “grant agent,” or some such authority. Since the message comes from someone known, as opposed to a stranger, this appeal gets viewed with less suspicion than something out of the blue.</p><p><strong>What happens to the aging brain?</strong><br>clintonherald.com — Many senior citizens call me and report the various scams and frauds they encounter, whether they lost money or not. And often in these calls, the senior will comment, “I think they are targeting us, seniors.” In some kinds of scams that is certainly true, but until last week, I’d never considered one big reason scammers zero in on seniors.</p><h1 style=text-align:center>Frequently Asked Questions About Randy Meier</h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-randy-meier></span>Who is Randy Meier?<span
