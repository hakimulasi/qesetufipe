The<a href=#> <i>Love Is Blind</i></a> women fervently defended pal<a href=#><strong> Zanab Jaffrey</strong> </a>after she accused her ex-fiancé, <a href=#><strong>Cole Barnett</strong></a>, of <a href=#>body-shaming during the season 3 reunion</a> — and they are not backing down.</p><p class=p1>“There will be no apology from me. There are multiple reasons why we stuck by her,” <a href=#><strong>Alexa Alfia</strong></a> wrote via Instagram Story on Thursday, November 10, resharing the 32-year-old London native’s Thursday social media post about the breakup. “We spent almost every day together so I will not take advice from anyone who was not there.”</p><p class=p1>Alexa, 27, added: “There are two sides to the story and I still stand by what I said. The clementine story is irrelevant.”</p><p class=p1>Zanab and Cole, 27, <a href=#>got engaged during Love Is Blind season 3</a>. After a rocky journey together, the flight attendant <a href=#>chose to call off their nuptials</a> during the finale, which aired earlier this month.</p><p class=p1>“I tried to be very clear at the altar [about] exactly why I was leaving and why it was a no,” <a href=#>she exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i>ahead of the season 3 finale</a>. “It was deflected to me having a bad attitude and not being sweet enough and not having fun conversations, [being] passive aggressive. My mental health was questioned. So, I definitely did try [to tell him].”</p><p class=p1>Zanab doubled down on her breakup reasoning during <a href=#>an appearance on the season 3 reunion</a>, which dropped on Netflix on Wednesday, November 9, as <a href=#>she accused Cole of body-shaming her</a> throughout their relationship.</p><p class=p1>“The pushing food away from me, the asking me if I’m going to eat that, trying to get me to order a salad, the daily comments about my face and my body were not used,” Zanab <a href=#>claimed during Wednesday’s episode</a>, noting it was her ex’s “saving grace” that a bunch of footage was not shown. “And that’s great because it really did protect you and you are now denying it and calling me a liar in front of all these people.”</p><p class=p1>While Cole denied her claims, Alexa stood by her pal.</p><p class=p1>“I think so many things happened off camera. He’s, like, likable when you’re watching it and just knowing what I know … it’s hard because I think Zay is such an incredible, incredible woman,” Alexa — who <a href=#>married <strong>Brennon Lemieux</strong> during the season 3 finale</a> — told hosts <a href=#><strong>Nick Lachey</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Lachey</strong></a> during the reunion.</p><p class=p1>Zanab went on to detail one particular disagreement, in which Cole seemingly questioned her intentions to eat two clementines. Netflix aired the deleted scene during the finale, which<a href=#> prompted viewers to criticize Zanab’s interpretation of events</a>. The Texas-based realtor has since continued to maintain her version of the story, writing via Instagram on Thursday that <i>Love Is Blind </i>fans have “different triggers” than she does.</p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Colleen Reed</strong></a>, who <a href=#>married <strong>Matt Bolton</strong> during the season 3 finale</a>, also chimed in, noting she “forever” stands with her pal.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Cole has not publicly addressed the fallout from the cuties controversy, though he does feel remorse that his actions <a href=#>affected Zaneb’s self-worth</a>. “I sure hope I didn’t shatter her self-confidence,” <a href=#>he told <i>Us</i> before the finale dropped</a> on the streaming platform. “But, for sure, I see where she’s coming from and … why she would’ve felt that way.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to see how the <i>Love Is Blind </i>ladies are supporting Zanab:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkubDCxGagrGWSobavsNJmmKWdqJZ6pLvLpZyepl2ivLOxjJ2cn52emXq7rc2amWaZnZ6xbq%2FOpZxmnKKWuqJ7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meghan-markles-navy-j-crew-wool-coat-is-back-in-stock-details.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meghan Markles Navy J.Crew Wool Coat Is Back in Stock: Details</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joseph-scott-hatleys-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joseph Scott Hatleys net worth, biography, fact, career, awards and life story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demi-bagby.html>Demi Bagby Biography | Age, Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Boyfriend?|</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-waters-net-worth.html>Derek Waters Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doechii.html>Doechii</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./former-dc-artist-ethan-van-sciver-claims-superman-will-be-made-gay-in-future-comics.html>Former DC Artist Ethan Van Sciver Claims Superman Will Be Made Gay In Future Comics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-refill-pre-inked-stamps-html.html>How do you refill Pre Inked Stamps?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
