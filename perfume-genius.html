His parents had got divorced when he was a teenager and he used to live with his mother after that.</li><li>He was interested in music and arts from a very young age. He had studied painting at school and had also taken piano lessons.</li><li>Perfume Genius was an openly gay student at his school and he would often get bullied as a result. He was even sent death threats by some of his schoolmates but unfortunately, his complaints were always ignored by the school’s administration. He eventually dropped out of high school due to the stress.</li><li>A couple of years after this, he was attacked by a group of men in his locality. Fed up with the constant abuse, he left Seattle and moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. There, he worked for some time as a doorman at a local club.</li><li>Perfume Genius decided to return to Seattle in 2005 and pursue a career in music. He began getting recognition in 2008 when he started sharing his music on the Myspace social networking site under the pseudonym Perfume Genius. He was soon signed up by Matador Records and released his first studio album titled Learning&nbsp;in 2010. Most of the tracks on the album were recorded in his name.</li><p>Featured Image by Perfume Genius / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqmcq56lorJus8SnoK6rXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./randall-cobb-career-stats-height-weight-family-college-teams-salary-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Randall Cobb: Career stats, height, weight, family, college, teams, salary, net worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./one-below-a-lieut-nyt-crossword-clue-1093211.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>One below a lieut NYT Crossword Clue</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demi-bagby.html>Demi Bagby Biography | Age, Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Boyfriend?|</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-waters-net-worth.html>Derek Waters Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doechii.html>Doechii</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./former-dc-artist-ethan-van-sciver-claims-superman-will-be-made-gay-in-future-comics.html>Former DC Artist Ethan Van Sciver Claims Superman Will Be Made Gay In Future Comics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-refill-pre-inked-stamps-html.html>How do you refill Pre Inked Stamps?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
