Kicking off the show with “…Ready for It,” Taylor Swift had theatrics throughout while incorporating intimate moments on an acoustic guitar.</p><p>Playing in Philly on the 13th and 14th, Swift was happy to be home as she grew up in Reading, PA. She played the two shows to sold-out crowds after visiting her old tree farm, eating a cheesesteak and some water ice.</p><p>Swifties know that the number 13 is significant to the “Delicate” singer, so it was only fitting, as Swift mentioned, to have her hometown show on Friday the 13th.</p><p>Being all about women empowerment, Swift’s openers were Camilla Cabello and Charli XCX, who also rocked the stadium. The singers joined her on stage for her famous hit, “Shake It Off.”</p><p>From beginning to end, fans were out of their seats singing and dancing along to old and new songs. Swift incorporated at least one song from every album on the tour <a href=#>setlist</a>, along with one surprise song each night. Night one was granted with the “Speak Now” hit, “Never Grow Up,” again feeling nostalgic being home, which brought us to tears.</p><p>With big snakes, water fountains, fireworks, and many lights on the stage, Swift’s incredible vocals, and dancing were accompanied with many great visuals.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/taylor-swifts-hometown-show-was-one-to-remember-02-300x225.jpg alt width=300 height=225 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Aside from the main stage, there were two b-stages where Swift would sing acoustically. She was trying to be as close to everyone as possible with the stage layout.</p><p>During “Delicate” and “Bad Blood,” Swift flew through the air reaching the fans up high at Lincoln Financial Field.</p><p>We were in awe of how amazing Swift’s concert was. There was never a boring moment and even fans who only know the “Old Taylor.” could still enjoy the numerous old hits she performed.</p><p>Before and after shows, Swift hosts an exclusive meet and greets for fans she and her team picked out. In this particular pre-show meet and greet, a couple, who met at her Red Tour, got <a href=#>engaged</a> right in front of her and made news headlines throughout the country. Baby, she just said, yes!</p><p>If you have a chance to see the “Look What You Made Me Do” singer live, do not pass up the opportunity. It is a concert you will never forget.</p><p>We are so happy we attended the Reputation Stadium tour and wish we could do it over and over and over again if we could.</p><p>Next stop: Cleveland, OH!</p><p>Have you attended a show(s) on the Rep tour?
