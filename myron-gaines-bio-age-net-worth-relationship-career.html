There are also speculations that Fresh Prince CEO Walter Weekes is involved with this endeavor.</p><p>Amrou offers a variety of fitness-related services via this website. A consultation via audio/video call can be scheduled online.</p><p>Before beginning the Fresh and Fit Podcast with Walter, he uploaded YouTube workout videos.

However, it is believed that only the complete episode is posted on Rumble. Only about one-third of each program is uploaded to YouTube.</p><p>After Andrew Tate’s participation in the first podcast, its popularity increased.
