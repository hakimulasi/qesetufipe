Much like Stay’s vivacious personality, the nearly 90-minute service was filled with humor. As attendees filed through the door, <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Stay’s Game diss</a> blared over the speakers and lended some comedic relief.</p><p>From there, several of his friends and family took the podium to share a few words about Stay. Perhaps the most moving was a tearful eulogy from Stay’s young step-daughter who called him the “nicest and funniest guy” she’d ever met.</p><p></p><p>Stay called out The Game for his attempt to bait <a href=# rel=noopener>Eminem</a> with “The Black Slim Shady” diss track via Instagram in August.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The text at the top of the post read: “Dear Slim I Wrote You But You Still Ain’t Callin,” a nod to Em’s 2000 song “Stan” about an obsessed fan. In the caption, Stay condemned “The Black Slim Shady” and suggested he was disappointed in his actions.</p><p>He also challenged him to a battle, writing, “You seem very eager to battle. Specifically a ‘white boy.’ Well why don’t you do a real battle and come see me. We can do it in LA. Yeah, you’re way bigger than me in the music world, of course.”</p><p>But Pat Stay never got the chance. Instead, he was <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>killed at The Yacht Club Social</a> in Halifax on the morning of September 4.
