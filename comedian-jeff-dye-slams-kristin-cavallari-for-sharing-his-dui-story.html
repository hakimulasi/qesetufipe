I jumped in the cold shower, I put a hat on and just got in my Tesla,” Dye recalled, noting that he was going to meet an ex-girlfriend. “Teslas are very fast and so I just lost control of my car and crashed it. This is 9 hours after I went to sleep. It wasn’t like I was leaving a bar, I wasn’t hammered.”</p><p>While he “didn’t feel drunk” at the time of the accident, Dye was still concerned about “some alcohol” being in his system. So, he “ran from the car.”</p><p>“Then, they arrested me at a coffee shop in front of my ex, in front of everyone at the coffee shop too,” Dye recalled. “It was wildly humiliating.”</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in October that Dye had been arrested for fleeing the scene of a traffic collision and driving under the influence. The Burbank PD revealed that he had collided with a tree and fled the accident on foot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Comedian-Jeff-Dye-Is-36-Days-Sober-Says-He-Was-a-High-Functioning-Alcoholic-575.jpg><p>Dye’s aforementioned ex was <a href=#><strong>Kristin Cavallari</strong></a>, who <a href=#>recounted the same incident</a> on her “Let’s Be Honest” podcast in October, weeks after the accident, without using his name. (Cavallari and Dye <a href=#>split in March 2021</a> after five months together.)</p><p>“I go, ‘Can you guys tell me what is going on?’” Cavallari recalled during the October 24 episode, revealing that she spoke to the arresting officers. “One of the police officers goes, ‘There was a report of a hit-and-run down the street and he matches the description of the guy.’”</p><p>Dye wasn’t too happy that Cavallari spoke publicly about his accident and subsequent DUI.</p><p>“Kristin telling the story on her podcast for clicks, which f—k her … I it’s not her story to tell,” Dye said during Thursday’s “Smoochietown” episode, calling Cavallari “a terrible person” for posting photos of his totaled car on her Instagram Story.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It was very terrible, and it hurt my feelings a lot,” Dye added. “I don’t think people realize how horrific that made me feel. Like, I don’t know if anyone will ever know. I don’t know how to explain it. Imagine the worst thing that ever happened to you and strangers are looking at you like <a href=#>at a coffee shop</a>.”</p><p>Returning to the conversation about his sobriety, Dye revealed that he’s “never felt better.” He added, “I wish I’d have done it sooner.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacp52asaqtzWahnp6WYrG6sYyso5qlo2K4s7XSraCnZZOWw6K4y5qpomWWpL9uv8eaqaKml2K1qr%2BMnayiZaOpvLPFjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-383717-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dekker Edward Gosselaar Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biograp</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./boris-beckers-former-business-partner-demanding-millions.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Boris Becker's Former Business Partner Is Demanding Millions</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demi-bagby.html>Demi Bagby Biography | Age, Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Boyfriend?|</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-waters-net-worth.html>Derek Waters Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doechii.html>Doechii</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./former-dc-artist-ethan-van-sciver-claims-superman-will-be-made-gay-in-future-comics.html>Former DC Artist Ethan Van Sciver Claims Superman Will Be Made Gay In Future Comics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-refill-pre-inked-stamps-html.html>How do you refill Pre Inked Stamps?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
