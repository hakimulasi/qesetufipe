But the Valentine’s Day 2022 episode saw him show the love and apologise for his wrongdoing.</strong></p><p>Award-winning rapper Peter and his co-star Cisco had argued after it was revealed that while traveling,&nbsp;Peter’s&nbsp;then-estranged wife Amina Buddafly crashed at&nbsp;the music executive’s home.</p><p>The pair had been close friends before the beef, but managed to settle the drama by the finale episode of VH1 Family Reunion: Love and Hip Hop Edition. But there could be an influence for Cisco’s apologies – his zodiac sign.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/02/GettyImages-481793711-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cisco-rosado-s-lahh-drama>Cisco Rosado’s LAHH drama</h2><p>Cisco ended up having some beef over the past LAHH season, mainly over <a href=#>Peter Gunz</a>‘ ex-wife Amina Buddafly. When she stayed at the rapper’s home, Peter wasn’t happy about it, despite his close friend insisting nothing happened.</p><p>Other issues between the two Creep Squad members also involved Cisco stopping Peter from receiving his money. Peter then took to Instagram to reveal he’s ready to take Cisco on for a boxing match. He <a href=#>wrote</a>:</p><p>Looks good on the gram but without legs and cardio you will get the sh*t beat out of you. Don’t let my age fool you lil bro, boxing in the ring and fighting on Love & Hip Hop is two different things!! No security, no @monascottyoung and no @stefateaser to talk us down!!</p><p>He later posted a <a href=#>photo</a> of Cisco with his son, and wrote in the caption:</p><p><a href=#>@iamtarawallace</a>&nbsp;said don’t forget&nbsp;<a href=#>@cisco_rosado</a>&nbsp;is godfather to our son Gunner. I’m training to knock him out and she sends me this.. I think she hates me too..&nbsp;<a href=#>@celebrityboxing1</a>&nbsp;what’s the odds on me?</p><p>However, Cisco settled things with a public apology to Peter during the February 14th episode. It also comes after Peter demanded an apology and his money from Cisco, which ended up with them having a physical altercation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#LHHFamReunion</a> I truly wish everyone started the family reunion the same way they ended it. <a href=#>@Cisco_Rosado</a> I wish u could have been this upfront from the start, yeah I was hard on u but I hope u continue to resolve ur problems in a healthy manner</p>— Its_Ms_Em (@EmilyConville) <a href=#>February 15, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-his-zodiac-sign-explains-apology>His zodiac sign explains apology</h2><p>Cisco’s apology to those he feuded with actually saw Rich Dollaz shake his hand in tears. Rich told his friend: “We can’t help you if we don’t know what’s going on with you, right? You’ve got to come to us as your brothers.”</p><p>His public sorry – on the mic – involved Cisco saying he “probably irritated half of y’all“, before he went on to say that he feels he rejects the concept of family.</p><p>Citing that the trio are the ‘Creep Squad’, Rich Dollaz and Peter Gunz encouraged their buddy to “open up” in future.</p><p>The traits of someone with a Cancer sign are labelled as: nurturing, sensitive, compassionate, self-protective, security-seeking and offering, and loving. So it’s clear Cisco is a softie at heart who just wanted to stop arguing with his friends.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Cisco Rosado (@cisco_rosado)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-react-to-cisco-s-sorrow>Fans react to Cisco’s sorrow</h2><p>After Cisco made the public apology to his LAHH co-stars, many across social media reacted.
