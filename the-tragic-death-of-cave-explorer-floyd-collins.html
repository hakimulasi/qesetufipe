As <a href=#>noted by the National Park Service</a>, they owned the Crystal Cave, discovered by their son Floyd in 1917. But their land was too far down the road on which all the tourists were driving their new <a href=#>cars</a>. All the other caves were swallowing up the city folk before they could get out to the Crystal Cave, and it got very few visitors. But Floyd was determined to get a piece of the tourist cave pie. He knew of one called Sand Cave that was located on the road ahead of most of the other show caves, and he made a deal with the landowner, a Mr. Doyel. He'd explore it and see if he could make it profitable. If so, he'd split the profits with Doyel, and they'd all get rich.</p><p>Floyd armed himself with a kerosene lantern and headed down into the cave. But it didn't take long for him to come across some difficult challenges. The cavern quickly narrowed, and he was soon crawling along on his belly, pushing his lantern in front of him. When it flickered out, he decided to turn back, despite having seen the cave open up ahead. But on his way back, a 27-pound rock wedged his ankle in place, and Floyd found himself trapped over 150 feet below the earth's surface.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BmGtqcWxfqbWmedOrmKChk2Kxpq3ToWSonl2YrrexjJ6vqaSfp7KzecWlprKcXZi8rbjIp6po</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vanessa-morgan-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Vanessa Morgan Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./seat-restraint-on-a-plane-2-wds-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Seat restraint on a plane: 2 wds.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demi-bagby.html>Demi Bagby Biography | Age, Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Boyfriend?|</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-waters-net-worth.html>Derek Waters Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doechii.html>Doechii</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./former-dc-artist-ethan-van-sciver-claims-superman-will-be-made-gay-in-future-comics.html>Former DC Artist Ethan Van Sciver Claims Superman Will Be Made Gay In Future Comics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-refill-pre-inked-stamps-html.html>How do you refill Pre Inked Stamps?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
