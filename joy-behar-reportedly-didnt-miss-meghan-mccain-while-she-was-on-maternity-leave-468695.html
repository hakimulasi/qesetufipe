Page Six says the pair of co-hosts got into it again on Tuesday’s episode of The View during the “Hot Topics” segment.</p><p>According to the outlet, Behar, 78, and McCain, 36, were discussing whether there should be two political parties in the United States, and McCain suddenly piped up and said out loud, “excuse me, I was speaking!”</p><p>McCain – <a href=# rel=noopener>who just got back from maternity leave on Monday</a> – told her repeatedly that Joy missed her so much, and more importantly, she missed fighting with her. Behar responded by claiming she didn’t miss her at all.</p><p>McCain then appeared shocked and offended by Behar’s remarks, saying how she was just teasing her, and Behar responded with something so “nasty” and “rude.” Whoopi Goldberg went on to tell her, “everybody stop.” People on social media praised Behar for being more honest.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Meghan: "Joy, you missed me so much when I was on maternity leave.

Another wrote that Joy’s comments reflected those of many other people who are just getting back to work right now in the new year.</p><p>As most know, Behar and McCain have fought each other on camera for a long time. Back in July, the pair of co-hosts got into a fight over<a href=# rel=noopener> Ivanka Trump</a>‘s pro-Goya view. McCain reportedly said to her co-host that she was paid to talk about her views on the program, and if she didn’t want her there, she would just have to leave.</p><p>Even though a lot of people complain about the fighting on The View, many viewers find the back and forth between Meghan and the others to be an important part of the program.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The View has struggled over the years to maintain its viewership and its hosts, but the presidency of Donald Trump and other issues du jour have indirectly increased the program’s ratings due to the co-hosts having a lot more to talk about.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeapMZursShmKtlopq9sL7TnpulsV2ZtqW602akoqujYrqms8eapWalk5iuqrqMsJ%2BipJViwKmxjLCYrGWfo3qurdOeqaehpK56rbHAr5xmbGZtg3qBjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./letoya-luckett-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>LeToya Luckett Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jenna-bush-has-dinner-with-parents-sister-for-1st-time-in-decade.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jenna Bush Has Dinner With Parents, Sister for 1st Time in Decade</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./demi-bagby.html>Demi Bagby Biography | Age, Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Boyfriend?|</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./derek-waters-net-worth.html>Derek Waters Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doechii.html>Doechii</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./former-dc-artist-ethan-van-sciver-claims-superman-will-be-made-gay-in-future-comics.html>Former DC Artist Ethan Van Sciver Claims Superman Will Be Made Gay In Future Comics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-refill-pre-inked-stamps-html.html>How do you refill Pre Inked Stamps?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe.
