Since his in-ring persona of Rocky Maivia, to the cocky, charismatic and highly athletic member of the Nation of Domination to the corporate champ and to his Brahma Bull that took 2000 by storm and made him what he is today.<p>Now The Rock however his a funny cat, when it comes to be memorable and a big household name - back in 1998, where The Rock won his first WWF Championship in the Survivor Series tournament, he turned into a beloved athletic crowd turned babyface, to the biggest heel in the roster, when he backstabber Mankind and pretty much everyone by joining into the dark side, or the McMahon side. However, some may agree that when The Rock turned into the biggest champion of the industry, he wasn't really a must-see superstar with the likes of Undertaker, Mankind or Steve Austin - in reality he was a uppercard that was given a chance and ran with it. Six months after the first win, The Rock was already a three time WWF Champion, until he faced Steve Austin and was defeated in the main event of WrestleMania.</p><p><b>But when did you start watching The Rock as a true WWF main eventer, and as a big household name?</b> Because it may be just me, but even though Rocky was popular with the fans, and that he was ready for his run, I think that losing the championship so many times in a such a short time period hurt him in the short term (even though Mankind vs. Rock was always great).</p><p>Now some additional questions to make it a great discussion, like I always find to have with you Old-School folks:</p><ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>What was the feud that you saw from The Rock and thought that this guy would be a main eventer in the future?
