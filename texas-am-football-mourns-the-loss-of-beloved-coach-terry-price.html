Price was a standout player and coach for the Aggies, and his impact on the team, community and football world at large will be remembered for years to come.</p><p>Price was born in 1968 and grew up in Texas. He attended Texas A&M University where he played as a defensive lineman from 1986-1989. He earned All-Southwest Conference honors twice during his college career and was part of the original “Wrecking Crew” defense that helped lead the Aggies to their first conference title in over 30 years. After graduating, Price joined the coaching ranks at Texas A&M as a graduate assistant in 1990 before becoming a full-time assistant coach in 1993. During his time with the Aggies, he coached several successful players including Von Miller, Damontre Moore and Myles Garrett.</p><p>“Terry was an incredible mentor to so many young men throughout his career,” said former teammate Ray Childress. “He had an unwavering commitment to excellence both on and off the field that inspired everyone around him. His passing is a tremendous loss for our program and our community.”</p><p>Price also made an impact beyond football. He was known for his philanthropy work with local charities such as Big Brothers Big Sisters of Brazos Valley and The Boys & Girls Club of Brazos Valley. In addition, he served as president of The Association of Former Students from 2009-2010 and was inducted into their Hall of Fame in 2011.</p><p>The cause of death has not been released yet but it is believed that Price had been battling health issues prior to his passing. In memory of Coach Terry Price, Texas A&M has announced plans to hold a memorial service later this summer as well as establish an endowment fund in his name for student scholarships within the athletic department.</p><p><strong>Condolence Shared on Social Media for Terry Price</strong></p><p>TexAgs shared on Facebook:- Terry Price ’92 touched the lives of so many in Aggieland and beyond.</p><p>With heavy hearts, Billy Liucci, Jason Howell and Ryan Brauninger remember the incredible life and legacy of a Texas A&M legend.</p><p>Good Bull Hunting Shared: Terry Price made an impact on so many people, but perhaps none more so than the players he coached.</p><p>Dewayne Shephard Shared on Facebook: Big Reggie&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reginald Howard</a>&nbsp;called me and told me my teammate and childhood friend……Class of the 1986 Plano Wildcats, a member of the Texas A&M coaching staff…. just passed away.
