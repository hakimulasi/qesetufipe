The band was the brainchild of agent/producer <a href=# title="Maurice Starr Net Worth">Maurice Starr</a>. Knight joined along with this older brother Jonathan and a couple other members. The band was signed to Columbia Records and released their self-titled debut album in 1986. The first two singles off the album did not receive much airplay but the band was able to secure a deal for a second album due to Starr's diligence.</p><p>Dissatisfied with the overly pop sound of their first album, the members of the band, including Knight, decided they wanted more input into how their second album sounded. Knight secured an associate producer credit on the album, called "Hangin' Tough," which went on to experience significantly more success than their first after its release at the end of 1988. The first single off the album, "Please Don't Go Girl," climbed to number ten on the Billboard's Hot 100 Singles Chart. Their second and third singles launched the band into popularity and they were soon touring to sold-out shows. By the end of 1989, the album had reached the number one spot on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart and had gone eight-times platinum.</p><p>New Kids on the Block continued growing in popularity throughout the beginning of the 1990s.
