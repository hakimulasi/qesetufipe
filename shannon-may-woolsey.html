Of course, the sweat and anger are concentrated on a single goal and the sudden adrenaline rush we feel when the competition is fierce. These things make us one with the player we look up to, and the phenomenon explains our inclination towards our favourite sport.</p><p>Besides these underlying factors, motivation is another thing that drives players’ performance on the field. We all have felt that, haven’t we? We tend to perform more or run that extra mile when a loved one supports us from behind. This discussion brings us to the topic of cheerleaders. They are the energetic group who fight the battle alongside athletes on the sidelines.</p><p>Therefore, cheerleading has developed into a severe career over the years. Several cheerleaders excel at the simple art of motivating their allies on battlegrounds. One such famous name is Shannon Woolsey. So, what makes her so unique to the world of cheerleading? Read more to explore her career and achievements.</p><h3><span id=Who_is_Shannon_Woolsey_Age_Birthday_Parents_Birth_date><strong>Who is Shannon Woolsey?&nbsp; (Age, Birthday, Parents, & Birth date)</strong></span></h3><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/shannon-woolsey-age.jpg alt="Shannon Woolsey Age" width=640 height=640 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Shannon is a famous name in the vast world of cheerleading. The British native celebrates her birthday with her friends and family on the 23rd of February every year. She was born in 1998, which makes her around 25 years old. Despite her young age, the girl bags several achievements under her name. Her name increased in popularity when her group became the theme for Netflix’s reality series “Cheer”. The series aired in 2020 and gained massive success throughout the globe. The cast even made multiple appearances on “The Ellen Show”.</p><p>Woolsey grew up in Houston, Texas, alongside her parents. The family moved to Texas from Britain after her father Gary got an offer to work at an oilfield waste management company. The firm operates from the outskirts of Houston. Gary is 59 years old and supports his daughter’s career choices and heights. Details about his wife are hard to find, and Shannon does not share information on her parents that often. Most of the time, the girl and her dad talk about their hometown and how much they miss Great Yarmouth.</p><h3><span id=Cheerleader_Career_and_Net_Worth><strong>Cheerleader, Career, and Net Worth</strong></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/shannon-woolsey-net-worth.jpg alt="Shannon Woolsey Net Worth" width=640 height=640 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Shannon’s career started at the age of four. At that age, young Woolseywast was fascinated with the art of cheerleading. She enrolled in gymnastic classes as soon as her family moved to Texas. She shared in a session that she and her mother could never concentrate on gymnastics because the gym had a cheer program. I mean, who does not get fascinated with such energy and passion?</p><p>After 2-3 more years of gymnastics, she finally decided and started cheering at the same gym for Cheer Nation. Starting at level three, she faced many challenges in the process. At one time, she even broke her elbow and underwent surgery only to rejoin her passion with more conviction. After some years, her gym merged with Prodigy All-Stars, and Shannon made her way to the junior level 5 team, Moonlight. With some more obstacles, young Woolsey became part of the first senior world team called Prodigy Midnight in 2012.</p><p>Eventually, Shannon made her way to her dream team, which is Cheer Athletics Cheetahs. The gymnasium was a 4 hours ride from their residence, and the aspiring girl drove her way back and forth for two years. As a part of the team, she won two major titles. She proudly wears those two rings in her homepage picture. After her high school career, the girl became the part of Woodlands Elite Black Ops, which was just 45 minutes away from her home. She ended her all-star career with an NCA title, which remains one of her most prized memories.</p><p>Shannon chose Oklahoma State University for her college education. The cheer program at OSU is well known for its quality and high-calibre performance. But, it seems Woolsey could not find the proper connection in Oklahoma. After a semester there, she started staying at home doing online classes at a community college located in Houston. Again, the girl got bored with the structural education system and reached out to Cheer Athletics for a chance to rejoin the team. She joined an all-girls team called Panthers in 2017 and placed second at the Cheerleading World Championships.</p><h3><span id=College_Cheerleading><strong>College Cheerleading</strong></span></h3><p>In her sophomore year, she started her education at Navarro College, famous for its cheer programs worldwide. She started cheerleading under Navarro’s flag name and also participated in the Cheer Athletics on Wildcats 2018. She won NCA, second place at the World Championships, and a Collegiate NCA with Navarro. The following year, she dropped her all-star career and focused all her mentality on the Navarro team. The budding cheerleader wants to grab another collegiate win to her collection. She is also helping as a part of Cheer Athletics Swoosh Cats.</p><p>To this day, Shannon has spent a total of twelve years on the world of cheerleading. Despite all this hard work and prizes, she is majoring in Kinesiology and hopes to become a Physical Therapist after her school work. Her achievement- the list is quite long, and surprisingly, the cheerleading prodigy wants to follow another profession. She is a two-time Majors Champion, National Champion, Collegiate National Champion, and two-time second-place winner in the World Championship. She is still an essential part of Navarro College cheerleading team which has a glorious history of kissing the Collegiate National Championship for fourteen times.</p><h3><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Twitter_Account><strong>Social Media, Instagram, & Twitter Account</strong></span></h3><p>Despite her busy schedules and dreams, the British cheerleader takes time to bond with her fans. She is primarily active on her Instagram page, which includes lifestyle, cheer, and fitness-related content. According to current data, her official page celebrates 248 thousand followers with 1,962 following pages. She has 581 posts on her profile to this day. Another one Shannon’s outlet is her Twitter account. She has 17.2 thousand followers and frequently posts her thoughts and news updates via her account.</p><h3><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></span></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHBqJ2boZ9jsLC5jqyfmqaepLtuucCyZLCnn6HApsWO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-ed-orgerons-first-wife-colleen-orgeron.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Ed Orgerons First Wife Colleen Orgeron?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./159400-where-oj-simpsons-kids-nicole-brown-everything-know.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where are OJ Simpson's kids with Nicole Brown?
